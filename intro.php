            <p class="intro-title-info">What is UNIX? </p>
            <p class="intro-info"> Unix is an operating system that acts as an intermediary between a computer's hardware and its software applications. It provides a set of tools and services to 
                manage and execute programs, handle files, and facilitate communication between different components of a computer system. Unix is known for its simplicity, modularity, and powerful
                 command-line interface, allowing users to interact with the system through text commands. It was developed in the late 1960s and has since influenced the design of many other operating systems.</p>
